FinTech start ups are driven by developers or engineers. These 
are the people with the vision and skills to create real innovation in Financial 
Services. This space is heavily regulated however, and navigating the licensing 
regime needs professional guidance. This is where we can help.__

We can help you 
figure out the licensing needs of your business. To date we have worked on

offering new products with often unclear regulatory requirements. We can guide 
you through the requirements.__

If yoou are a start up, funds are bound to 
be tight. We will work with you and have taken equity in payment in the past. In
