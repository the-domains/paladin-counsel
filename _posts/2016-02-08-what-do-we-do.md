We 
can help you answer the following questions:

Do you need 
authorisation?

Which law would apply to you?

Is this 
jurisdiction right for you?

**License 
Applications**  
This includes analysing the requirements for your 
business, drafting all of the dosuments, creating the required controls, 
submitting the application on your behalf and dealing with the questions which 
the regulator will forward once they have reviewed your application for 
authorisation

**Post
