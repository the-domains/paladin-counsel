Paladin Counsel is a compliance consultancy firm which assists its clients in ensuring that they are meeting their legal and regulatory obligations in the UK and Ireland. Our areas of expertise include License Applications, Data Protection, Anti Money Laundering, Corporate Governance, General Compliance, Risk and Internal Audit.

Each consultant at Paladin Counsel holds legal qualifications and has many years of experience working in the fields of compliance and risk at global entities. The staff are all members of the Association of Compliance Officers in Ireland and each of them also serves on the committees which run the Association, truly driving the practice of compliance in industry and keeping their fingers on the pulse of new developments in the legal and regulatory environment as they happen.

We are different from the usual compliance and legal firms. Most compliance professionals have a very narrow view of the world. They developed their careers in traditional banks, and so operate in a world of black and white. We have worked in start ups and understand that rules need to be interpreted in such a way as to allow the business to operate. This is especially important with products that do not fit neatly into the existing regulatory framework. This is why we are a good fit for FinTech start ups. They need support from a partner that will assist them in finding a way forward instead of telling them what they can't do.
