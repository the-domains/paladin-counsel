We look after everything from helping you understand whether you need to be licensed, to guiding you through the process, to helping you maintain authorisation.

**Initial Research**  
We can help you answer the following questions:  
Do you need authorisation?  
Which law would apply to you?  
Is this jurisdiction right for you?

**Post Authorisation - Outsourced Compliance Function**

**License Applications**  
This includes analysing the requirements for your business, drafting all of the documents, creating the required controls, submitting the application on your behalf and dealing with the questions which the regulator will forward once they have reviewed your application for authorisation.

Regulated business must maintain a Risk and Compliance function. The minimum requirement here would be a Compliance Officer and assistant which will costaround â‚¬130,000 per annum. You could outsource this function for a small fraction of this.
