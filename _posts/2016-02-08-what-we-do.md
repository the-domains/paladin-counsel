We look after everything from helping you understand whether you need to be licensed, to guiding you through the process, to helping you maintain authorisation.

**Initial Research**  
We 
can help you answer the following questions:  
Do you need 
authorisation?  
Which law would apply to you?  
Is this 
jurisdiction right for you?****

**License 
Applications**  
This includes analysing the requirements for your 
business, drafting all of the documents, creating the required controls, 
submitting the application on your behalf and dealing with the questions which 
the regulator will forward once they have reviewed your application for 
authorisation.

**Post 
Authorisation - Outsourced Compliance Function**

Regulated 
business must maintain a Risk and Compliance function. The minimum requirement 
here would be a Compliance Officer and assistant which will costaround â‚¬130,000 
per annum. You could outsource this function for a small fraction of 
this.
